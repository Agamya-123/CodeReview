1️⃣ Summary
The provided `sun` function is highly problematic due to its reliance on undeclared global variables and lack of input
validation. The review addresses these critical issues, along with minor naming and documentation improvements, to
deliver a robust and maintainable `sum` function.

2️⃣ Strengths
* **Simplicity:** The core logic `a + b` is simple and direct for its intended purpose.

3️⃣ Issues Found
* **❌ Undeclared Variables:** The variables `a` and `b` are used directly within the function without being declared as
parameters or local variables. This means the function relies on `a` and `b` being defined in a higher (likely global)
scope, which is a major anti-pattern leading to unpredictable behavior, difficult debugging, and potential
`ReferenceError` exceptions, especially in strict mode.
* **❌ Lack of Input Validation:** There is no check to ensure that `a` and `b` are actually numbers. If they are
strings, `a + b` would result in string concatenation (e.g., `'1' + '2'` becomes `'12'`), and if they are other types
(e.g., `null`, `undefined`, `object`), the result would be `NaN` or a `TypeError` depending on the values, leading to
silent failures or unexpected outputs.
* **❌ Misleading Function Name:** The function is named `sun`, which is likely a typo and should be `sum` to accurately
reflect its purpose. Clear naming is crucial for code readability and maintainability.
* **❌ Missing Documentation:** The function lacks any form of documentation (e.g., JSDoc) explaining its purpose,
parameters, and return value. This makes it harder for other developers (or your future self) to understand and use the
function correctly.

4️⃣ Recommended Fixes

* **✅ Declare Parameters Explicitly:** The variables `a` and `b` should be passed into the function as explicit
parameters. This makes the function self-contained, predictable, and reusable, eliminating reliance on external scope.
* **✅ Implement Robust Input Validation:** Add checks to ensure that both inputs are of the expected `number` type. If
validation fails, throw a `TypeError` to clearly indicate that the function was called with invalid arguments, allowing
the calling code to handle the error gracefully. This prevents unexpected behavior and improves the reliability of the
function.
* **✅ Correct Function Naming:** Rename `sun` to `sum` for clarity and adherence to standard naming conventions.
* **✅ Add JSDoc Comments:** Provide comprehensive JSDoc comments to document the function's purpose, expected parameters
(types and descriptions), and the return value. This significantly enhances code readability and maintainability.

5️⃣ Final Optimized Code

```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
*
* This function ensures that both inputs are valid numbers before performing
* the addition, throwing a TypeError if invalid types are provided.
*
* @param {number} num1 - The first number to be added.
* @param {number} num2 - The second number to be added.
* @returns {number} The sum of num1 and num2.
* @throws {TypeError} If either `num1` or `num2` is not a number.
*/
function sum(num1, num2) {
// Input validation: Ensure both arguments are strictly numbers.
// This prevents unexpected behavior from type coercion (e.g., string concatenation)
// and clearly signals invalid usage.
if (typeof num1 !== 'number' || typeof num2 !== 'number') {
throw new TypeError('Both arguments must be numbers.');
}

return num1 + num2;
}

// --- Usage Examples (for testing and demonstration) ---

// console.log(sum(5, 3)); // Output: 8
// console.log(sum(-10, 20)); // Output: 10
// console.log(sum(0.5, 0.2)); // Output: 0.7

// // Example of invalid usage (will throw TypeError):
// try {
// console.log(sum(5, '3'));
// } catch (error) {
// console.error("Error:", error.message); // Output: Error: Both arguments must be numbers.
// }

// try {
// console.log(sum(null, 10));
// } catch (error) {
// console.error("Error:", error.message); // Output: Error: Both arguments must be numbers.
// }

// try {
// console.log(sum(undefined, 5));
// } catch (error) {
// console.error("Error:", error.message); // Output: Error: Both arguments must be numbers.
// }
